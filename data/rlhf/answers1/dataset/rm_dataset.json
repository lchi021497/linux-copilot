Since you're dealing with a list coming to STDIN and rm expects parameters, you need to use xargs.\nAnother thing is that you have to escape a dot when you grep for a filename. Your Command should look sth. like this.:\nls | grep -v 'logtest\\.' | grep 'logtest' | xargs rm \n\nNote that you do a doubled grep. The first one to exclude your logtest.* itself and the second to include your remaining files with logtest.\n", "\nSomething like this should work:\nfor file in *; do\n    # Ensure that the file is a file and not a directory.\n    [ -f \"$file\" ] && {\n        if printf \"%s\" \"$file\" | grep \"^logtest.\" > /dev/null; then\n            rm -f \"$file\"\n        fi\n    }\ndone\n\nThis doesn't parse the output of ls, ensures that the file is actually a file and works with spaces aswell (names like \"logtest \").\n'^' means to match the start of the string so that stuff like \"test_logtest\" won't be matched, and the '.' at the end ensures that there are characters after the match. > /dev/null stands for redirecting the output of the grep command to /dev/null (All content sent there is discarded), which basically hides the grep matches from showing up in the output.\n", "\nTry rm -rf /web/node_modules/ffmpeg-static/ffmpeg\nI assume that is directory, not a file.\n", "\nYou can use find with -type f for files only and -maxdepth 1 so find won't search for files in sub-directories of /path/to/directory.  rm -i will prompt you on each delete so you can confirm or deny the delete.  If you dont care about being asked for confirmation of each delete, change it to rm -fv (-f for force the delete).  The -v flag makes it so that with each delete, a message is printed saying what file was just deleted.\nfind /path/to/directory -maxdepth 1 -type f -exec rm -iv {} \\;\n\nThis should meet the criteria:\n\nNOT directories \n  NOT subdirectories \n  NOT files in these subdirectories.\n\n", "\nfind PATH -maxdepth 1 -type f -delete\n\nBUT this won't prompt you for confirmation or output what it just deleted. Therefore best to run it without the -delete action first and check that they're the correct files.\n", "\nSince this is high on google search, the simplest answer is:\nrm $directoryPath/*\n\nwhere $directoryPath is the directory you want to empty. Credits should go to cbm3384 (that for some reason has gotten negative votes for this answer, why?)\nIf you do not want to confirm:\nrm -f $directoryPath/*\n\nIf you don't believe try man rm or \nmkdir -p 1/2/3; echo 'hello1' > 1/hello1.txt; echo 'hello2' > 1/2/hello2.txt;echo 'hello3' > 1/2/3/hello3.txt\nrm 1/2/*\n\nThe above creates a directory structure, that has 'helloX.txt' in each folder (X is the directory level). rm 1/2/* deletes hello2.txt and leaves the other structure intact.\nAlso rm */*/* deletes only hello2.txt. It is the only that matches the pattern.\nJust an example of a Makefile that cleans cakephp tmp-directory and leaves the directory structure intact:\nclean:\n    -rm -f tmp/*\n    -rm -f tmp/*/*\n    -rm -f tmp/*/*/*\n    -rm -f tmp/*/*/*/*\n\nMinus in front of the rm means \"do not halt on errors\" (unremoved directory returns an error). If you want some level to be saved, just remove that line, e.g. second rm line removes logs.\nLet me know if you have a system that does something else (BSD?).\nEDIT: I tested this on ubuntu 12.04, osx lion and sourceforge.net shell.
