The copy will be owned by A and thus A can change permissions of the copy. After that, run some regular process to clean up B's directory in order to save space if that's an issue\nalternatively, you could have B on the source computer log into A's account on the receiving computer, and then the file ends up in A's ownership. If you do not want to give B the password of A, you could do this using an ssh certificate. But of course this has other security risks, so the cp method above is safer\nfinally, on unix it is generally not a good idea to make files writable for \"other\", and often not even for \"group\", so permission settings of 775 or 755 are much safer and preferred. Otherwise anyone on the same computer could modify the file or make it an empty file. Even on a private computer this is good practice, because sooner or later one of these files will get copied to a multi-user system and no-one remembers to check the permissions\n\nHopefully some of these hints are useful.\n", "\nI am not sure what you want to achieve, so here's a couple of suggestions:\n\nif the goal is simply for the file to have specific permission settings, and ownership change is secondary, you could set the permissions correctly on the source computer and then use a transfer method that preserves permissions (scp -p or some such)\nnote that a script owned by A can still be run by B if A has set the permissions correctly (group and other executable bit).
