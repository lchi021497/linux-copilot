You computer must accept ssh connections\nOn my mac it was as simple as enabling it in the Preferences / Sharing panel.\n\n2. Your router needs to forward the connection to your computer.\nGo to your router's settings page in your browser (typically 192.168.0.1 but varies depending on the router). Find the port forwarding section and forward some port to your computer on port 22.\nThis is how it looked on my tp-link:\n\nHere I am making sure that port 22000 is forwarded to my computer (192.168.0.110) on port 22.\n3.

This adds a layer of safety on top of nohup, as it keeps connections alive: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tmux\n\nI combined the rsync command with the while command to enforce that the copy is attempted an infinite number of times even if the pipe breaks:\n\n\nwhile ! rsync <your_source> <your_destination>; do echo \"Rsync failed. Retrying ...\"; done\n\nThis approach is brute force and it will work if for each attempt, rsync manages to copy at least a few files.
