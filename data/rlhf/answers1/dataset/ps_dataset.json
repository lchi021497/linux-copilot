How do you list all processes, which consider a given directory -- or a subdirectory thereof -- its working-directory (cwd)?The best method I was able to come up with was to invoke: lsof -b -w -u $(whoami), then parsing the last column looking for my directory, and then running the second column (the PID) through sort -u.Is there, perhaps, anything better?"], "chosen": ["\nYou can find a window with xdotool by name, window class, etc. To search for a window by name with, use:\nxdotool search --name 'My Window Name'\n\nThis will print the decimal window id to stdout. The --name flag matches the part or all of the window name. In a browser, that generally includes the current tab name. xdotool can also return the corresponding pid like this:\nxdotool search --name 'My Window Title' getwindowpid\n\nHe is an example of sending a series of keypresses and mouseclicks to a window.\n# Find window with title containing 'My Window Title, activate it,\n# move the mouse to coordinates 200x400, left click, then press F5\nxdotool search --name 'My Window Title' windowactivate mousemove 200 400 click 1 key F5\n# Store window id of the active window\nWINDOW_ID=$(xdotool getactivewindow)\n# Type a series of characters into the window\nxdotool type \"this text is being typed into window\" --window $A\n\n", "\nYou can use awk to extract the ID from the output of wmctrl -l.\nFor example:\nwmctrl -l | awk '/Google Chrome/ {print $1}'\n\nxdotool will likely take that hex IDs just fine but if it can't you can convert that to the decimal representation with strtonum:\nwmctrl -l | awk '/Google Chrome/ {print strtonum($1)}'\n\nHow you match just the window you want from the output in awk is up to you and your requirements.\nIt is probably worth noting that xdotool also appears to have a search command which takes all sorts of specifiers and patterns that you can use to get the window ID of windows you want to operate on. (It even supports a stack of matches that it supports a special format of \"window ID\" to operate on directly for \"chained commands\".)\n", "\nIf you are running a linux system and are using x-display manager, the command xwininfo to get window information may work for you.\nYou can run or script the command xwininfo -root -tree and get a detailed and organized output of the xwindows system and the window IDs. You can see how I have used the xwininfo output in a small bot I created for runescape. I store the hexidecimal ID of the window title and then convert it to binary using printf %i and the hex of the window I am interested in. From there, I can script xdotool to do whatever I want in or with the window by making it the active window and moving the mouse to it using xdotool.\n\nSo the steps for this method are:\n\nGet the window information using xwininfo -root -tree.\nStore the window ID that you are interested in.\n(There may be multiple listings of the window name with different\n hex IDs and you will have to know the parent hex ID which is\n usually the first listed and commonly outlines the child processes in\n a sub-tree.)\nConvert the window hex ID into binary so xdotool can recognize it.\nUse the windowactivate option with xdotool in order to getxdotool\nto interact with the correct window.\nPerform whatever next steps you wish.\n\nSo it's really quite simple, although a bit time-consuming at first, but once you develop your own method for storing the parent window's hex ID, the rest can be easily automated and no worries arise. If you have trouble determining which hex ID belongs to the parent window, there are ways of checking for parent vs child processes but I don't know if you want to go into all of that.

The argument is parsed literally.\n\nHow to use \"Regular Expression\" in ps?\n\nYou can patch procps ps to support it, most probably (with yet another!) additional flag. The patch looks simple, basically another tree traversing parse_* function that uses regex.h instead of strncmp.\nI doubt such patch would make it upstream - it's typical to use other tools, most notably pgrep or shell with a pipe and grep, to filter process by command line name. ps has to stay POSIX compatible, and has so many options already.\nNote that regular expression is not \"globbing\". Consult man 7 glob vs man 7 regex. Regular expression chromi* would match chrom or chromiiiii - chrom followed by zero or more i.\nNote that unquoted arguments with \"trigger\" characters undergo filename expansion (ls 'chromi*' vs ls chromi*). This is different than passing the literal argument  when there exist files that match the pattern. If the intention is to pass the pattern to the tool, quote the argument to prevent filename expansion.\n", "\nYou did say bash, right?
