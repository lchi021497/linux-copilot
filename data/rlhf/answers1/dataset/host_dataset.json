(mvn compile running in a docker container).

My docker client is on a different machine to the host machine. I'm trying not to build and and push and run a image built from my project directory - I want the convenience of the docker one-liner.

By default they use localhost and 9999.\nWhen install system service, it is necessary to specify the correct /controller host:port values if management binding has been updated.\nThe error below in the log indicates the CLI command line cannot connect to the management interface when shutting down:\nCould not connect to remote://localhost:9999. The connection failed\nConfirm the /controller parameter used when configuring system service matches the management interface and socket binding definition in JBoss configuration file (standalone.xml / domain.xml and host.xml).\nWhen configuring system service, if not specified, the default configuration for controller is :\n/controller HOST:PORT    The host and port of the management interface.

Other commands like docker build, docker import and docker cp are able to send local data across from client to host. docker run can send stdin to the server though. \nDocker build\nA docker build will actually run on the remote host your client points at. The \"build context\" is sent across and then everything is run remotely. You can even run the maven build as part of the build:\nFROM mvn-image\nCOPY . /workdir\nRUN mvn compile\nCMD ls /workdir\n\nThen run\ndocker build -t my-mvn-build .\n\nYou end up with an image on the remote host with your build in it. There's no local-build/push/remote-build steps. \nDocker run Stdio\ndocker run can do standard Unix IO, so piping something into a command running in a container works like so:\ntar -cf - . | docker run -i busybox sh -c 'tar -xvf -; ls -l /'\n\nI'm not sure how that's going to work with the mvn command that you supplied to run a container, under the normal Docker client it would be something like:\ntar -cf - -C /projects/project-dir . | \\\n  docker run mvn-image mvn compile sh -c 'tar -xvf - -C /workdir; mvn compile'\n\nStorage Plugins\nOtherwise you could mount the data on the host from the client somehow. There are NFS and sshfs storage plugins. \nRsync\nUsing rsync or something similar to send your project to the Docker host would be a lot more efficient over time. \nDocker cp script\nThe docker cp is a fairly simple solution though. If you put it in a script, yet get a \"one liner\" to run.\n#!/bin/sh\nset -uex\ncid=$(docker create mvn-image mvn compile)\ndocker cp /projects/project-dir $cid/workdir\ndocker start $cid\ndocker logs -f $cid\n\n", "\nAlthough to avoid huge problems and configuration issues Windows server is used all over the world to host ASP.NET apps.\nHow ever you can explore Mono Project to use Linux to host ASP.NET Webapps.\nHope this helps.\n"], "rejected": ["\nIt is possible to interact with VMs that are in XenServer, but you need XenCenter app to do that (make sure to get a compatible version of XenCenter eg if you are using XenServer 7 you must use XenCenter 7 or 8 etc).\nAfter installing XenServer, connect it to your XenCenter and then all the VMs will appear in a list at the left side.
