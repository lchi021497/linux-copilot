They can e.g. save a picture using a web form, change execute bit and run it as a script on your system.\nPerhaps, rw access for owner and group and r for others would be a better option.\n", "\nI had a similar problem, but the solution for me was to use the uid and gid options of the CIFS filing system.

But why on earth would you want to? It might make sense for the directories, but why set the execute bit on all the files?\nI suspect what you really want to do is set the directories to 755 and either leave the files alone or set them to 644. For this, you can use the find command. For example:\nTo change all the directories to 755 (drwxr-xr-x):\nfind /opt/lampp/htdocs -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \\;\n\nTo change all the files to 644 (-rw-r--r--):\nfind /opt/lampp/htdocs -type f -exec chmod 644 {} \\;\n\nSome splainin': (thanks @tobbez)\n\nchmod 755 {} specifies the command that will be executed by find for each directory\nchmod 644 {} specifies the command that will be executed by find for each file\n{} is replaced by the path\n; the semicolon tells find that this is the end of the command it's supposed to execute\n\\; the semicolon is escaped, otherwise it would be interpreted by the shell instead of find\n\n", "\nIf you want to set permissions on all files to a+r, and all directories to a+x, and do that recursively through the complete subdirectory tree, use:\nchmod -R a+rX *\n\nThe X (that is capital X, not small x!) is ignored for files (unless they are executable for someone already) but is used for directories.\n", "\nYou can use -R with chmod for recursive traversal of all files and subfolders.\nYou might need sudo as it depends on LAMP being installed by the current user or another one:\nsudo chmod -R 755 /opt/lampp/htdocs\n\n", "\nThe correct recursive command is: \nsudo chmod -R 755 /opt/lampp/htdocs\n\n-R: change every sub folder including the current folder\n", "\nTo set to all subfolders (recursively) use -R\nchmod 755 /folder -R\n\n", "\nchmod 755 -R /opt/lampp/htdocs will recursively set the permissions.

This is useful when working with special modes such as the sticky bit, which you probably want to apply to directories but not files.\nUses a technique straight out of the man pages (see below).\n\nNote that I have not confirmed the performance difference (if any) between this solution and that of simply using two find commands (as in Peter Mortensen's solution). However, seeing a similar example in the manual is encouraging.\nExample from man find page:\nfind / \\\n\\( -perm -4000 -fprintf /root/suid.txt %#m %u %p\\n \\) , \\\n\\( -size +100M -fprintf /root/big.txt %-10s %p\\n \\)\n\nTraverse the filesystem just once, listing setuid files and direct\u2010\ntories into /root/suid.txt and large files into /root/big.txt.\n\n", "\nUse:\nsudo chmod 755 -R /whatever/your/directory/is\n\nHowever, be careful with that. It can really hurt you if you change the permissions of the wrong files/folders.\n", "\nchmod -R 755 directory_name works, but how would you keep new files to 755 also? The file's permissions becomes the default permission.\n", "\nFor Mac\u00a0OS\u00a0X 10.7 (Lion), it is:\nchmod -R 755 /directory\n\nAnd yes, as all other say, be careful when doing this.\n", "\nFor anyone still struggling with permission issues, navigate up one directory level cd .. from the root directory of your project, add yourself (user) to the directory and give permission to edit everything inside (tested on macOS).\nTo do that you would run this command (preferred):\nsudo chown -R username: foldername .*\n\nNote: for currently unsaved changes, one might need to restart the code editor first to be able to save without being asked for a password.\nAlso, please remember you can press Tab to see the options while typing the username and folder to make it easier for yourself.\n\nOr simply:\nsudo chmod -R 755 foldername\n\nbut as mentioned above, you need to be careful with the second method.\n", "\nThere are two answers to finding files and applying chmod to them.\nThe first one is find the file and apply chmod as it finds (as suggested by @WombleGoneBad).\nfind /opt/lampp/htdocs -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \\;\n\nThe second solution is to generate a list of all files with the find command and supply this list to the chmod command (as suggested by @lamgesh).\nchmod 755 $(find /path/to/base/dir -type d)\n\nBoth of these versions work nicely as long as the number of files returned by the find command is small. The second solution looks great to the eye and is more readable than the first one. If there are a large number of files, the second solution returns an error: Argument list too long.\nSo my suggestion is\n\nUse chmod -R 755 /opt/lampp/htdocs if you want to change the permissions of all files and directories at once.\nUse find /opt/lampp/htdocs -type d -exec chmod 755 {} \\; if the number of files you are using is very large. The -type x option searches for a specific type of file only, where d is used for finding the directory, f for file and l for link.\nUse chmod 755 $(find /path/to/base/dir -type d) otherwise\nBetter to use the first one in any situation\n\n", "\nYou want to make sure that appropriate files and directories are chmod-ed/permissions for those are appropriate. For all directories you want \nfind /opt/lampp/htdocs -type d -exec chmod 711 {} \\;\n\nAnd for all the images, JavaScript, CSS, HTML...well, you shouldn't execute them. So use\nchmod 644 img/* js/* html/*\n\nBut for all the logic code (for instance PHP code), you should set permissions such that the user can't see that code:\nchmod 600 file\n\n", "\nI think Adam was asking how to change the umask value for all processes that are trying to operate on the /opt/lampp/htdocs directory.\nThe user file-creation mode mask (umask) is used to determine the file permissions for newly created files.
