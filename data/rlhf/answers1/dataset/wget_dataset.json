capture wget's output in an aux. variable.\n", "\nGiven:\n\nthat you don't want to use JSON libraries.\nand that the response you're parsing is simple and the only thing you care about is the presence of substring \"success\", I suggest the following simplification:\n\n#!/bin/bash\n\nwget -O - -q -t 1 http://localhost:8080/tester | grep -F -q '\"success\"'\nexit $?\n\n\n-F tells grep to search for a fixed (literal) string.\n-q tells grep to produce no output and instead only reflect via its exit code whether a match was found or not.\nexit $? simply exits with grep's exit code ($? is a special variable that reflects the most recently executed command's exit code).\n\nNote that if you all you care about is whether wget's output contains \"success\", the above pipeline will do - no need to capture wget's output in an aux. variable.\n", "\nAs of April 2023\nFor windows\nwget https://repo.continuum.io/archive/Anaconda3-2023.03-Windows-x86_64.exe\nFor MacOS based on your system
