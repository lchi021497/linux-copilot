So what I do is: \n\nDownload Intellij\nExtract intellij to /opt-folder: sudo tar -xvf <intellij.tar> -C /opt/ (the -C option extracts the tar to the folder /opt/)\nCreate a Desktop Entry File called idea.desktop (see example file below) and store it anywhere you want (let's assume in your home directory)\nMove the idea.desktop from your home directory to /usr/share/applications: sudo mv ~/idea.desktop /usr/share/applications/\n\nNow (in a lot) Ubuntu versions you can start the application after the GUI is restarted.

The given script in the link installs Oracle Java 7 for you and gives you the choice between Community and Ultimate Edition. It then automatically downloads the newest version for you, extracts it and creates a desktop entry.\nI have modified the scripts to fulfill my needs. It does not install java 8 and it does not ask you for the version you want to install (but the version is kept in a variable to easily change that). You can also update Intellij with it.

What sudo does is create a new *sub*process that runs as root. The subprocess could be just a regular program (e.g. sudo cp ... runs the cp program in a root process) or it could be a root subshell, but it cannot be the current shell.\n(It's actually even more impossible than that, because the sudo command itself is executed as a subprocess of the current shell -- meaning that in a sense it's already too late for it to do anything in the \"current shell\", because that's not where it executes.)\n", "\nI'm not sure if this breaks any rules but \nsudo bash script.sh\n\nseems to work for me. \n", "\nI think you are confused about the difference between sourcing and executing a script.\nExecuting a script means creating a new process, and running the program. The program can be a shell script, or any other type of program. As it is a sub process, any environmental variables changed in the program will not affect the shell.\nSourcing a script can only be used with a bash script (if you are running bash). It effectively types the commands in as if you did them. This is useful as it lets a script change environmental variables in the shell.\n\nRunning a script is simple, you just type in the path to the script. . is the current directory. So ./script.sh will execute the file script.sh in the current directory. If the command is a single file (eg script.sh), it will check all the folders in the PATH variable to find the script. Note that the current directory isn't in PATH, so you can't execute a file script.sh in the current directory by running script.sh, you need to run ./script.sh (unless the current directory is in the PATH, eg you can run ls while in the /bin dir).\nSourcing a script doesn't use the PATH, and just searches for the path. Note that source isn't a program - otherwise it wouldn't be able to change environmental variables in the current shell. It is actually a bash built in command. Search /bin and /usr/bin - you won't find a source program there. So to source a file script.sh in the current directory, you just use source script.sh. \n\nHow does sudo interact with this? Well sudo takes a program, and executes it as root. Eg sudo ./script.sh executes script.sh in a sub process but running as root.\nWhat does sudo source ./script.sh do however? Remember source isn't a program (rather a shell builtin)? Sudo expects a program name though, so it searches for a program named source. It doesn't find one, and so fails. It isn't possible to source a file running as root, without creating a new subprocess, as you cannot change the runner of a program (in this case, bash) after it has started.\nI'm not sure what you actually wanted, but hopefully this will clear it up for you.\n\nHere is a concrete example. Make the file script.sh in your current directory with the contents:\n#!/bin/bash    \nexport NEW_VAR=\"hello\"\nwhoami\necho \"Some text\"\n\nMake it executable with chmod +x script.sh.\nNow observe what happens with bash:\n> ./script.sh\ndavid\nSome text\n> echo $NEW_VAR\n\n> sudo ./script.sh\nroot\nSome text\n> echo $NEW_VAR\n\n> source script.sh\ndavid\nSome text\n> echo $NEW_VAR\nhello\n> sudo source script.sh\nsudo: source: command not found\n\n", "\nBasically sudo expects, an executable (command) to follow & you are providing with a .\nHence the error.\nTry this way $ sudo setup.sh \n\n", "\nIf you really want to \"ExecuteCall a shell script in current shell with sudo permission\" you can use exec to...\n\nreplace the shell with a given program (executing it, not as new process)\n\nI insist on replacing \"execute\" with \"call\" because the former has a meaning that includes creating a new process and ID, where the latter is ambiguous and leaves room for creativity, of which I am full. \nConsider this test case and look closely at pid 1337\n# Don't worry, the content of this script is cat'ed below\n$ ./test.sh -o foo -p bar\n\nUser ubuntu is running...\n PID TT       USER     COMMAND\n 775 pts/1    ubuntu   -bash\n1408 pts/1    ubuntu    \\_ bash ./test.sh -o foo -p bar\n1411 pts/1    ubuntu        \\_ ps -t /dev/pts/1 -fo pid,tty,user,args\n\nUser root is running...\n PID TT       USER     COMMAND\n 775 pts/1    ubuntu   -bash\n1337 pts/1    root      \\_ sudo ./test.sh -o foo -p bar\n1412 pts/1    root          \\_ bash ./test.sh -o foo -p bar\n1415 pts/1    root              \\_ ps -t /dev/pts/1 -fo pid,tty,user,args\n\nTake 'exec' out of the command and this script would get cat-ed twice.
