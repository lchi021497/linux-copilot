{"prompt": ["I am trying to generate a memory utilisation report for couple of Linux servers. I want to collect the % memory utilisation of servers for every 10 mins and I think sar can help to get that data. Earlier I though column %memused will directly give the % memory utilisation of the server. But after reading couple of articles I am suspecting that this not the correct memory utilisation of the server and therefore I want to know the best way to calculate the memory utilisation of the server.Can anyone help me to calculate % memory utilisation of the server for every 10 mins using sar report or any other best to get the % memory utilisation.06:39:47 PM kbmemfree kbmemused  %memused kbbuffers  kbcached  kbcommit   %commit\n06:39:48 PM    616552   3307708     84.29    245368   2174816   1196772     24.07\n06:39:49 PM    616552   3307708     84.29    245368   2174816   1196772     24.07\n"], "chosen": ["\nThe actual free memory on the system is free+buffers+cached.
