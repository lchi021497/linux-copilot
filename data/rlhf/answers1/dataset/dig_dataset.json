That will give you all the published addresses for that site. But, and I'm guessing here, it sounds like that's not what you want. If what you want is to find out which IP ranges are assigned to Netflix the corporation, you can find that by looking it up in the various RIR databases (easiest via whois, as Sami says in a comment up there). Most of those addresses probably aren't being used for their web servers (but for mail, VPN, internal communications and such). Also, it's likely that a lot of their web presence aren't on those IP addresses, but on addresses belonging to some CDN.\nYou need to ask a better question if you want to get a useful answer.\n", "\ntry a soft link\n\nln -s /usr/lib64/libcrypto.so.10 /lib\n\nLet us know if that helped you.\nOr you can remove and install again using yum.

(If you don't like the raw output, add the sed command I've given at the end of this answer.)\nFor a /16 network I suggest something like this:\n\n    #!/bin/bash\n    N=192.168.\n    printf %s\\\\n -x\"$N\"{0..255}.{0..255} |\n    xargs -r -n64 -P64 dig +noall +ans +nocl +nottl\n\nThe -n64 means that each invocation of dig will output around 3800 bytes depending on how long the resulting names are. As long as the entire output of each dig is less than 4096 bytes, it will be written as a single write() syscall.\nIf you have long domain names causing interleaving, the simplest fix is to reduce the -n option, but that will make it somewhat slower.\nAnother way to mitigated this is to have each invocation of dig write to a separate output file, and then combine them at the end. For example:\n\n    #!/bin/bash\n    d=\"/tmp/tmpdir$$\"\n    mkdir \"$d\"\n    N=192.168.\n    p=0 w=64\n    for (( c=0 ; c < 256 ; ++c )) do\n        (( ++p <= w )) || wait -n\n        dig +noall +ans +nocl +nottl \"$N$c\".{0..255} > \"$d/$c\" &\n    done\n    wait\n    cat \"$d\"/*\n\nLastly, if you have administrative access to the authoritative nameserver, then you could configure the nameserver to allow zone transfers to a host of your choosing. Then you could get everything in a few seconds using a single command:\n\n    #!/bin/bash\n    dig @ns.your.domain. +noall +ans +nocl +nottl axfr 168.192.in-addr.arpa\n\nThe commands I've given above all output the raw dig format; you can convert this to the requested format using a filter like this:\n\n    #!/bin/bash\n    (command as above ...) |\n    sed 's/^\\([0-9.]*\\)\\..*[[:space:]]/\\1\\t/\n         s/\\.$//\n         s/^\\(.*\\)\\.\\(.*\\)\\.\\(.*\\)\\.\\(.*\\)\\t/\\4.\\3.\\2.\\1\\t/\n         s/\\t/  resolves to  /'\n\n", "\n\nQuery: 1: The number of queries in this session, which was one.\nIs the explanation right?\n\nYes, dig displays there the number of entries for the 4 sections: QUERY, ANSWER, AUTHORITY, ADDITIONAL.\n\nIf if it is right,can I have more queries at once,I saw all of examples in internet is always 1.\n\nYou can't.\nThe format seems to allow for it, however things were never really specified so it is not possible today, for at least the simple reason that the answer has a single return code to note the success or failure of the request, so if the request has multiple queries, some successul, some not, how could the return code handle that?\n", "\nTry this with awk\ndig +short ns kinoafisha.info | awk -v RS='' '{gsub(\"\\n\", \", \"); print}' >> text.csv\n", "\nYou are not saying if you are testing a recursive or an authoritative nameserver.\nYou also need to define valid.
