I verified that the tmp directory that belonged to the tmux session existed and lsof -p 7139 (the pid of tmux server) showed that the socket file is open:\nCOMMAND  PID  USER   FD   TYPE             DEVICE SIZE/OFF       NODE NAME\ntmux    7139 hari    5u  unix 0x0000000000000000      0t0 1712879255 /tmp/tmux-50440/default\n\nI also tried explicitly specifying the -S /tmp/tmux-50440/default to tmux but it didn't help. However, I read in the tmux man page that sending SIGUSR1 would make tmux recreate the socket file, so I tried that and I was able to immediately find the session and reattach:\n$ kill -s USR1 7139\n$ tmux ls\n0: 12 windows (created Mon Apr 18 21:17:55 2016) [198x62]\n\n", "\nThis happened to me when the Ubuntu desktop crashed and my gnome-terminal windows exited. I could still see the tmux process was running (ps aux | grep tmux) but for some reason tmux commands would not work to list the existing sessions. Apparently it wasn't finding the existing Unix socket of the still-running tmux process. The fix in this scenario is to locate the existing Unix socket and specify that to tmux using the -S flag; here's how:\nYou can find the PID of your still-running tmux process with this:\nps -p $(pidof tmux)\n\nNow take your PID (in my case, 6876) and run this to list any open Unix sockets:\nsudo lsof -Uap 6876\n\nHopefully you see output like this:\nCOMMAND  PID USER   FD   TYPE             DEVICE SIZE/OFF   NODE NAME\ntmux    6876  abe    3u  unix 0x0000000000000000      0t0 408477 socket\ntmux    6876  abe    4u  unix 0x0000000000000000      0t0 408478 socket\ntmux    6876  abe    6u  unix 0x0000000000000000      0t0 408479 /tmp/tmux-1000/default\n\nNow you can specify that existing Unix socket to your tmux command (using the -S flag), and you should be able to list-sessions and attach properly:\ntmux -S /tmp/tmux-1000/default list-sessions\ntmux -S /tmp/tmux-1000/default attach -t 0\n\n", "\nYou get this error indeed if there are no session open. If there are no sessions open there is no tmux server running so it can't connect to it.\nWith the -L option, you change the socket name the tmux server uses, it's not a way to name your sessions. You better use the following commands:\ntmux new -s name1\ntmux new -s name2\n\nThese will create 2 sessions on a server with the default socket name. Now you can do:\n$ tmux ls\nname1: 1 windows (created Mon Sep 22 10:34:40 2014) [158x40] (attached)\nname2: 1 windows (created Mon Sep 22 10:34:43 2014) [158x40] (attached)\n\nAnd you see all the sessions running on the server on the default socket. You can reattach one of them using:\ntmux attach -d -s name1\n\n-s specifies the name of the session\n-d will detach it from it's previous client (if it is attached)\nYou can also switch between sessions inside tmux with the choose-tree command which by default is assigned to the keystroke  C-s (prefix key + s). This is what I usually do.\n", "\nYou may have an error in your .tmux.conf. I had this problem until i took out this line from my .tmux.conf:\nset-window-option -g xterm-keys on\n\nYou could also try tmux -v and then look at the logs it prints.\n", "\nOne easy fix is to delete the tmp files left by the tmux server, for example, by doing $ rm -rf /tmp/tmux-xxx/. \n", "\nThe way TMUX(1) works is by having a client process (tmux) connect to a server process (tmux too, but not attached to a TTY), as shown in the following ps output:\n  PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND\n19229 pts/1    S+     0:00 tmux\n19231 ?        Ss     0:00 tmux\n\nThat shows that the client actually starts before the server (one could assume it forks it).\n\nAfter detach/re-attach, the same ps command outputs:\n  PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND\n19231 ?        Ss     0:00 tmux\n19290 pts/1    S+     0:00 tmux attach\n\nThis shows the tmux client as tmux attach, thus being a bit easier to understand.\n\nNow, if we look at the output of pstree in both of the above cases, we get in both cases (ignoring the pid change for tmux attach):\npstree -p\ninit(1)\u2500\u252c\u2500acpid(1824)\n        \u251c\u2500cron(1859)\n        \u22ee\n        \u251c\u2500sh(14146)\u2500\u2500\u2500tmux(19229)\n        \u2514\u2500tmux(19231)\u2500\u2500\u2500sh(19233)\u2500\u2500\u2500pstree(19234)\n\nClearly showing that the commands typed (pstree in this case) in the client process (PID 19229) get executed by the server one (PID 19231), thus allowing them to continue without SIGHUP in the event where the client terminal is lost (over ssh, for example).\n\nNow, to the question OP asked: what happens in the case where tmux returns failed to connect to server: Connection refused is that the server process (pid 19231 in our case) is unreachable, whatever the reason (it can be because the server process died; but also because the user executing the tmux client doesn't have the permissions to access the tmux socket, etc.)\nThe solution in that case is to grep for the tmux processes (via ps for example), and pray that you didn't get this error because the server died (so you can attach to it by using lsof to get what sockets it listens to). Otherwise, there is no way to attach to the server, as it is as dead as after a reboot.\n\nTL;DR:\nThis error can be given for multiple reasons, ranging from bug to critical failure (program died). In a nutshell, use the UNIX tools at your disposal to determine what socket does tmux use, if it is still running (there should be at least two processes if you have the tmux client running - that happens after invoking tmux or tmux attach from the shell) and thus if you lost your session or not.\nNote: as other answers pointed out, if the reason for this error to be shown is a socket error, you can use the -L flag to tell tmux to use a specific socket.\n", "\nThis may happen if you or any cleaning process delete files in /tmp/*. All your sessions data are lost if you can't recover those files. Killing all tmux instances and restart it is the only choice left, unfortunately.\n", "\nI was using another program inside of tmux (reattach-to-user-namespace), and I was getting this error when I switched computers because reattach-to-user-namespace was not installed. The fix was to simply run brew install reattach-to-user-namespace.\n", "\nThis happened to me because I ran tmux with another user (was root), and I tried to list sessions with my normal user..\nSo you might want to check the user with which you ran your tmux first.\nTo do so:\n$ ps -aef | fgrep -i tmux\nroot     7139     1  1  2016 ?
